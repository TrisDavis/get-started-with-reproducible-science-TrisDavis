# Get started with open reproducible science!

[Open reproducible science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/get-started-open-reproducible-science/) makes scientific methods, data and outcomes available to everyone. That means that *everyone* who wants should be able to **find**, **read**, **understand**, and **run** your workflows for themselves.

<img alt-text="Components of open science - accessible, reproducible, inclusive" src="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2021-11/Circle_Diagram_UPDATE_2.jpg?VersionId=pFRniRpjtgc_MEXUJKi9_sXLoMsSX.pB" width=500 />

Few if any science projects are 100% open and reproducible (yet!). However, members of the open science community have developed open source tools and practices that can help you move toward that goal. You will learn about many of those tools in [the Intro to Earth Data Science textbook](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/). Don't worry about learning all the tools at once -- we've picked a few for you to get started with.

1. Open reproducible science involves making scientific methods, data, and outcomes available to everyone.
2. Shell helps you efficiently work with many files and directories at once. Shell is the primary program that computers use to recieve code and return information produced by executing commands. 
3. Yes, a Jupyter Notebook file typically has a machine-readable name. The name of a Jupyter Notebook file should follow standard file naming conventions, such as not containing any special characters or spaces, and typically has the ".ipynb" file extension, which indicates that it is a Jupyter Notebook file.

I can write clean code by:
  * 


Advantages of clean code include:
  * `YOUR ANSWER HERE`


```python
# importing python libraries
import pandas as pd


```

Once you have run the cell above and imported `pandas`, **run the cell below**. It is a test cell that will tell you if you completed the task successfully. If a test cell isn't working the way you expect, check that you ran your code **immediately before** running the test.


```python
# DO NOT MODIFY THIS TEST CELL
points = 0
try:
    pd.DataFrame()
    points += 5
    print('\u2705 Great work! You correctly imported the pandas library.')
except:
    print('\u274C Oops - pandas was not imported correctly.')
print('You earned {} of 5 points for importing pandas'.format(points))
```

    ✅ Great work! You correctly imported the pandas library.
    You earned 5 of 5 points for importing pandas


**YOUR DATA DESCRIPTION AND CITATION HERE**


```python
rapid_city_temp_url = 'https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00024090/tmax/ann/2/1949-2023.csv'

rapid_city_temp_url 
```




    'https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/city/time-series/USW00024090/tmax/ann/2/1949-2023.csv'




```python
# DO NOT MODIFY THIS TEST CELL
resp_url = _
points = 0

if type(resp_url)==str:
    points += 3
    print('\u2705 Great work! You correctly called your url variable.')
else:
    print('\u274C Oops - your url variable was not called correctly.')

if len(resp_url)==117:
    points += 3
    print('\u2705 Great work! Your url is the correct length.')
else:
    print('\u274C Oops - your url variable is not the correct length.')

print('You earned {} of 6 points for defining a url variable'.format(points))
```

    ✅ Great work! You correctly called your url variable.
    ✅ Great work! Your url is the correct length.
    You earned 6 of 6 points for defining a url variable

Rewrite the code below to select columns by **name** instead of by **index**. You might find the [pandas User Guide section on slicing and dicing](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/indexing.html) to be useful. However - don't worry if you can't figure this out yet! We're going to talk a lot about how to use pandas `DataFrame`s.

  1. As you did above, rewrite the code to be more expressive
  2. Using the code below as a framework, write and apply a **function** that converts to Celcius.
     > **Functions** let you reuse code you have already written
  
  3. You should also rewrite this function name to be more expressive.

There are many other things you can do to customize your plot. Take a look at the [pandas plotting galleries](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html) and the [documentation of plot](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) to see if there's other changes you want to make to your plot. Some possibilities include:
  * Remove the legend since there's only one data series
  * Increase the figure size
  * Increase the font size
  * Change the colors
  * Use a bar graph instead (usually we use lines for time series, but since this is annual it could go either way)
  * Add a trend line
